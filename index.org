On this website, I write stuff. These are mostly unorganized notes.
* Writing setup in Emacs org-mode with pandoc
I have a file ~index.org~[fn:1] which contains the whole website. A Makefile is then used to convert the org file into html using ~pandoc~. A ~pandoc.css~ file is also included.

I would like for there to be a way to dynamically change the code snippet below whenever the Makefile changes, but as far as I know, this is not possible with code highlighting.

*Makefile:*
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
index.html: index.org pandoc.css Makefile gruvbox.theme
	pandoc -o index.html index.org --toc -H pandoc.css -s --highlight-style gruvbox.theme

gruvbox.theme: gruvbox.json
	cp gruvbox.json gruvbox.theme

clean:
	rm -f index.html gruvbox.theme
#+END_SRC

You may notice that I am using a custom highlight style (~--highlight-style gruvbox.theme~).

[fn:1] This is the file I'm editing right now.
